## Overall Vision
A top-down CO-OP ethereal survival game similar to Zomboid. However, instead of zombies, the player faces ethereal beings. Through the ever-growing sea of malicious yet surreal creatures, the player must find and reinforce a shelter whilst managing themselves and their friendsâ€™ necessary survival needs.
